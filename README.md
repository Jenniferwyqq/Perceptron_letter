In this project we use the binary perceptron algorithm to implement rudimentary character recognition on bitmapped fonts.

There are four goals for this project:

  Exploring the perceptron algorithm and the process of training and testing.
  
  Learning the basics of the Python programming language.
  
  Learning to work with vectors and matrices using the NumPy library.
  
  Using the Matplotlib library to plot a curve.
